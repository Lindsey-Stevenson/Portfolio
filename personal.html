            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>My partner's name is Ben, and we have been married for ten years. We have spent the entirety of our marriage living in Utah. We share a passion for traveling, cycling, exploring new restaurants, spending time in the mountains, and making memories with our children.</p>
            <p>Together, we have two sons. Our eldest, Beck, is five years old, and currently in kindergarten. He enjoys reading, practicing math drills, riding his bike, and engaging in imaginative play as a superhero or a soldier. His curiosity is boundless, and his imagination is remarkable. Our younger son, Otto, is seventeen months old. He is wild and playful, and constantly on the move. Otto loves playing with trucks and following his older brother around.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Cycling is my primary sport, and I have competed professionally in road, gravel, and mountain bike races across the nation. While I have stepped back from racing since the arrival of my second son, I still seize every opportunity to ride. I find great solace in cycling alone in the mountains, and I appreciate being part of the vibrant cycling community. In fact, my love for cycling is what brought my spouse and me together, and it has allowed me to forge incredible friendships over the years.</p>
            <p>In addition to cycling, I enjoy hiking and feel fortunate to have the Wasatch Mountains right in my backyard. My boys and I ski every weekend during the winter and occasionally go sledding. We also love taking our e-cargo bike to local parks, picking up treats along the way.</p>
            <p>I often travel to Moab, Utah, to visit my in-laws, as well as to Grand Junction, Colorado, my hometown, to see my parents. While cooking is not my forte, I do enjoy exploring new recipes to try and replicate. I love my time spent outdoors, but also enjoy cozy nights in watching a movie. I treasure time with my family, and cherish the moments I get to share with just my husband. I also value my solitude that allows me to reflect and recharge.</p>
